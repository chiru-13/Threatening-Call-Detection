You, sir, obviously do not comprehend the importance of no scopes. as a kind and generous wikipedian, take the time to understand the effect this article has on issues such as world hunger, which I hear Singapore has a lot of. By deleting this article, you are, in effect, fellating the proverbial penis of all that is evil. Why the fuck did you delete our goddamn article. Now my dreams, they are so lonely, as my article seems to be. Behind these blue eyes, i can see through your supposed good intentions, into the black soul that is your true self. My love for this article is vengance, that will not be free until i crush your soul and destroy any evidence of your pathetic presence on this earth. I hope you contract a foreign disease and your penis falls off, if you even have one. I will force your children into indentured servitude, and all of your lowly descendants will be cursed with abnormal navel hair growth forever. My angry, bloodthirsty army is waiting to beseige your house, and burn everything you have ever owned, until your physical being is engulfed by the black hole that is your perverted heart. I will also delete your slanderous works, and bring Singapore to a speedy, fiery deletion off of the face of the earth. I will not rest until complete vengance has been bought upon you, and the stairway to heaven crashes down upon you and your so called morales. God and Satan alike frown upon you from their thrones. Fuck you and all you stand for. You my good fellow are a Cunt and I hope you enjoy the rest of eternity in the fiery pits of hell. I hope that speedy death swarms about you like locusts, slowly devouring the very fabric of your being.",1

 Bye Bye Jerk! 

I guess this means you will be crying about the Nazis anymore.  What is your problem with Nazis anyway?  Did you date a Nazi woman and she broke your heart??  What a shame!!!

Your life isn't worth living anymore so pleasee KILL YOURSELF!

You know I'm right.  You've felt this way for a long time.  You've probably been thinking about killing yourself for quite some time.  I'm here to tell you, it's all right.  Go ahead.  Do it.  It won't hurt. Be brave.  All your troubles will be over.  You won't have the pain anymore.  Everyone else?  Don't worry, they'll get by.  

What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly?  It certainly IS your fault.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done  - and failed to do.  Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such  a weakling.  You're defective.  You've been that way for a long time.  You are proof that God makes mistakes.

Look at your life.  Failure after failure after failure.  And should we mention those """"things"""" that you did?  You know what I'm talking about.  I can't believe you did that!  You disgust me.  You should have died a long time ago.  You know I'm right.

 Fuck you, cunt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

try these important things and maybe you won't be such a sucker motherfucker:

1. Learn how to spell. If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

And you wonder why you need to join a fucked up cult to find friendship and loving. Dumb fuck!!!!!!""",1

Nobody really attacked me before I revealed my age here.  After I announced that I was 14, I was subject to a constant storm of harassment and abuse.

The same thing goes for when I was on The Sandbox when I was 11.  Before people knew my age, they didn't care.  After I told them my age, they hated me.

It's just so amusing how the idiot Soapboxers think of teenagers as being responsible for the """"decline"""" of The Soapbox (like it was ever any good to begin with).  This is funny, because the adults are the dumbest people here.  Mauricio, Chuppah, Redneckgirl, Pinky, Scooby, GG, ForeverLostTinkerbell, greenrabbit, StarRocketsInFlight, Bree-Robinson, enigma-72, CocaineNightmares, TokyoDome, Chad_Ocho-Cinco, Steve Lake...

...all adults.

The teenage posters here are typically the smartest ones.  Let's see... G-Dawg, Head_Banging_Brunette, ClassicAge, Metropolis (even though he's a bipolar weirdo), ChrisScript, just to name a few.

All I ever see adults posting is """"rate my poo!!1!"""", """"my ballz smell funny"""", """"whoz hawter: me or ur mom???//?/?"""", """"i like to rape little girls"""", and """"HEY GUYZ LOOK AT ME IM AN ATTENTION WHORE!!!!11!!1!""""  The adult posters here are immature, moronic, savage bullies with the mental capacity of a retarded 4-year-old.

Whereas, most of the teenagers here are thoughtful, intelligent, mature, and often profound.  But they're subject to constant schoolyard bullying by the idiot adult posters who think they're somehow superior because they were born (and dropped on their head) earlier.

Soapbox logic never fails to amuse me...

FUCK is an interesting word, and can be used in many ways. such as, FUCK YOU, Go Fuck yourself (no one else will) I FUCKED your mother, also who the FUCK do you think you are? do you think you are god? is that it? were you molested by your teacher as a child? i dont understand what would cause you to think your so fucking great. i raped all of your family members, and siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. i also raped your mother (she liked it) and so you are nothing. ABSOLUTLY nothing, and you should terminate your existance A.S.A.P. (As Soon As Possible just letting you know, because you are FUCKING RETARTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creat",1

 Why did Vladimir Putin kill them all? 

Shut up you fucking criminal KGB asshole, we just know Putin did it. 
In film Die Hard 2 they showed how easy it is to fool an airplane to land, but why kill them all? Who profited from this except NAZI Russia and former KGB agent Putin? THERES IS NO FREE PRESS IN RUSSIA!!! European Union said this!!! JOURNALISTS are KILLED if they criticize PUTIN in RUSSIA. PUTIN is STALINS comeback. Its a common fact that Putin hated some in the Polish delegation, but why kill all? Fucking animal Putin is just as psychotic and insane as Josef Stalin.

First off, I'm a faggot - not an article creator. I've received good ass in my work as a truck stop cocksucker, while stealing the prose and research of others. Cocksucking is, in my mind, the best feature of Wikipedia. My faggoty tastes are eclectic, but all end in a jizz shoter. I can bounce ten cocks all over the place. I've spent time sucking off Kim Kardashian, vandals and BBM in Richard Gere's asshole and Richard Simmons's asshole, and assisted in the development of a faggoty article on the jizzmaster himself, me, (the latter of which has since undergone faggoty tranny surgery and a tit job. Further revisions to my cock include trying to fuck my mother with it, which I am not entirely happy about, but heck, it's a mom I remind you all I am a faggot who wouldn't risk pissing with the seat down, so you can tell my nickname is a faggoty attempt to appear edgy.

 An open letter from the Wikipedia Review 

This is a message to Beam,

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch. WE call the shots. WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now? This site isn't a game, it isn't a place to 'chill' with your fags, and it isn't some fucking haven where people like you can get acceptance from people like US. IT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

This movie is like Napoleon Dynamite The audience loves it, even though there's actually nothing to it but clichés which literally get the shit beat out of them (as do most things in this movie). 

To be fair, Napoleon Dynamite's bullettime scenes were only in how slow the characters thought. All of them, multiplied together, gets an IQ of less than 50.

Is this the new style? To have something suck so badly (saving special effects) that people can't help but love it? I am going to kill someone; this is the new blockbuster style.

And before anyone starts trying to find out where I live, so they can hunt me down, I will reinforce that crochety old man persona with these parting words:

Hello jimmy boy,

I've just started editing this Wikipedia. When I go to other users pages I often find your creepy fucking head appearing from the left side of the screen.

It's disgusting. I'm an adult and I don't need a note from you.

Could you ask one of your programmers to stop having your creepy fucking head appear on the left side of people's screens? I've asked my brother to kill you if I have to see it again and he said he would.

I have told you and your sock/meat puppets a dozen or more times to stop your fucking spamming.

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

I've previously covered hate speech - see Enough Hate Spech To Stun An Ox, and Hatecrime.org has an extensive collection of hate speech targeting homosexuals. Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...

I hope you die in hell you filthy pig. your anime, filthy slum-apartment, plus your renowned dick sucking, qualifies you for no more than head prostitute of your filthy family.

They are when your mom is using dirty needles to shoot both your mom and dad up in the process. Clearly your mom died of a drug overdose.

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0

User:GFHandel is clearly correct here. DuLithgow’s coming in and deciding that this CAD editor is that is not notable, as  was clearly way off base. User:Ryan Vesey made this uncanny and pithy edit summary when he  “millions of google search results, take it to AFD if you wish”. Thus, Users , , and  just aren’t in agreement here.

Moreover, Duncan’s , over the last few days to delete all manner of CAD programs from this list is clearly without consensus and needs a clear consensus when the edits aren’t copyediting but are instead massive use of the [delete] key. Editors are all here on en.Wikipedia to build the project. The way things are done here are the product of years of consensus building and an evolution of processes. Moreover, the editors active on the CAD-related articles tend to have extensive experience with the subject matter. It is clear that the evolved intention of the list of CAD editors is to make it an inclusive and comprehensive list that readers can use as an authoritative source for what programs have been developed over the years. Before deleting scores of man-hours of material that other editors have slaved over, there must be a clear consensus here on this talk page for the material’s removal.

Since there is clearly no consensus for these latest edits throughout the project and here on this list,  to the previous consensus view. Please bear in mind that consensus can change. But we can not have consensus established by an editor testing the waters as to what content can merely be deleted from the project; clearly established consensus via discussion must occur here in advance of such moves.   17:05, 14",0

I had then a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy... The book was published at the height of the Cold War. Intellectual McCarthyism was not confined to the US...
The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''

So, yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received, in EPT's opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint. But in '76, (when The Making of the English Working Class was in its 5th Penguin reprint), things had moved on...   11:44, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0

 Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona 

Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you.  

 Peter III of Aragon 

What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what """"contemporary"""" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:
it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime
the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might
the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format
it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait
the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative
what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king

In your last edit summary, you ask """"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"""", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   

Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.

You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.

I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.

If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.  

I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?   

Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?  
Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.   
Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.  

 Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia 

I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring.   

Lecen is aware of the three-revert rule. Are you? You've reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours. You should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution, such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.",0

It should be obvious that that it is not the case of one troll ping-ponging himself. I use Australian IP adresses, and have a particular style of writing. The """"other one"""" has a Bulgarian IP address and writes quite differently. But look at it logically.  If it is two trolls ping-ponging, its a troll thread, best thing now is delete the whole thread.  If it is two trolls ping ponging, then, its a troll thread, and definitely the best thing is to delete the whole thread.
So it matters not - the best thing is to delete the whole thread - though it is probably too late now.  The troll that started it with his fake appology has got his kicks now, and the other potential trolls out there have had plenty of time to discover it and be inspired to try their own variation.
I suppose, thinking logically from your point of view, there is a third possibility.  It could be a ping-ponging troll that wants it deleted for some weird troll purpose, or two trolls, one of which wants it deleted for some weird troll purpose.  But what could that purpose be?  Trolls feed on exposure, not by invisibility.  If other trolls don't see the thread, or see it promptly removed, they loose their inspiration.
So, please, delete the damm thread.  Can't do any harm.  Either way makes no difference to me personally.

Ethnic Violence
I think the following paragraph should be removed from the article -

It has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners, such as gang rapes that occured in 2000 and 2002.

My main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported. Yes, whoever put it in has provided an article from the Australian as a source. However, if you actually read this article, it doesn't say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in 2000 and 2002. In fact, it only mentions rape once. Here is the relevant section of the article -

In an article on this page nearly two years ago (""""Don't turn a blind eye to terror in our midst,"""" January 12, 2004), I argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young Australian men and women - including murders, gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of Lebanese Muslim descent - would rise dramatically throughout Australia. These problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years.

So no mention of any kind of delayed response. Therefore, the idea is completely the POV of whoever wrote it, hiding behind a misrepresented source. It should go.""",0

Wait...how can the creators of Liberalism be called classical liberals, if Liberal means something different than its classic form?  Furthermore, how can something be classic when it was once origina.

Thus, I do not see a problem with mentioning how classical liberals believe themselves to be the true liberals and that """"modern welfare statist liberals"""" have perverted the meaning.  

Libertarians are a reaction from the virtual elimination of liberals/classical liberals from the political scene as both Democrats and Republicans continued to abandon their beliefs on freer markets and limited government.  Thats it.  There are various levels of libertarians and free market advocates, and only a few of them advocate anarchism.  I think you conflate free market with anarchy.  Furthermore, I think you've failed to realize that Milton Friedman considers himself a liberal while being a member of the REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!

Another supposed noted American libertarian is John Stossle, and he hates the term libertarian, he prefers to call himself a liberal but the meaning is something different from what it once was so he reluctantly refers to himself as a classical liberal for the less informed, or a libertarian for the most ignorant.

Also, although this is more easily rectified, the substituted version contains not a single wikilink, which makes it difficult for the reader to get a sense of context.

Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~""",0

Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.
Women can have a muscular orgasm if they repeatedly squeeze the vaginal muscle used to urinate.

They're allowed under certain, very limited circumstances. Single accounts are better for continuity, accountability, trust and stability - they help foster and maintain a transparent, open editing environment. This matters particularly when article content and best-editing practice are in dispute. You've evidently made an honest mistake, due to your unfamiliarity with the relevant Wikipedia policies.

Your IP account won't be deleted, as its history is relevant to editing on other pages.

 Kahan recentism 

I just reverted an edit by Vgy7ujm for two reasons. First, the relevant article was only published 4 days ago, and so it is too recent for the rest of the academic community to have chewed it over and responded in any way. The articles in Wikipedia are not random newsfeeds of the latest events in each topic, but are encyclopedic summaries based mainly on secondary sources, that give a balanced overview of their subject. Primary research sources published in the last few days rarely make an article, and should never be used at the end of a section implying that they may represent the 'last word' on a subtopic. Secondly, the abstract of the referenced paper actually says that, by setting experimental subjects """"“science comprehension” tests"""", that it has detected """"the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition"""". This is a long way from the much more even-handed coverage that Vgy7ujm gave it, by saying """"that global warming skeptics are as familiar with the relevant science as their opponents. They simply arrive at different conclusions."""" - as if this gives their antiscience views equal validity. I think we need to give things time, and if necessary, add a more balanced view of this research if, in time, it turns out to be notable.   """,0

1320,"Here's another go!

In biology, evolution refers to the processes that cause some inherited traits to become more common relative to others over time. Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.

Over time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]

[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.

However, you still should try to include some more information there, as it is a bit short. Include a short bit on her appearances and the critical reaction as noted above.
Concept and creation section looks good now, well done.
Expand or merge the Characterization section into other sections. With it that short, it seems as though you would easily graft it into appearances unless there's more info to be added.
You've met GA Criteria 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 easily.
""""She was once the most trusted advisor for the indecisive politician."""" is unclear. Who are you referring to? (Characterization section)
The article seems a bit short (this is my issue with Criteria 3, broadness). You seem to have covered most of the important bases, but there's not a whole lot of information in each. Some of the sections also cover information that would be better places elsewhere (as previously noted, in addition to mentioning Smart's Emmys in """"Concept and creation"""", it seems that would be better elsewhere or at least belongs in a subsection). Try working on how the article is laid out, and as Judgesurreal suggested, definitely use other articles as templates.
All in all, it looks pretty good, and would probably either pass or be an easily fixed-up """"on hold"""" if nominated for GA now. Well done, just consider taking a look at those to guarantee things. Best of luck!  (//c)

A few points if I may.

1)I wasn't really interested in this GW issue until I came here and realized how crappy the science was, and the writing, all of which based on models as far as the eye can see: the real quality of which is inversely proportional to the control of the information -mostly by people whose careers depend on it, namely modelers. 

2)As far as the table is concerned, like I said before, it's a unit increased in CO2, as in """"unit vector of change"""", for whatever use that might be, I just liked it; that's all it is. 

3)I'm also asking that if there is at least one single article, on any actual physical experiment, conducted in a microcosm, for instance, that could compliment the overwhelming propensity of models, it would be nice to include it here... provided it could get in.

Dear Lex, Thanks for your clarification of Judge Learned Hand. I guess I should not trust my memory.

The only times I remember citing blogs were the WSJwhen I cited the article, not the commentary, which was an interview. That was deleted.and when I used them as evidence of pro se dissatisfaction.  I see that you also deleted a quote of a court case that was in a blog.  I am positive that that was an accurate quote of a transcript with a statement by a federal judge.  I will have to go read up on Wikipedia sources again.

Also I am positive that the quote about the federal district court discouraging pro ses from using their mediation is correct, but I will have to check on the link.  Why didn't you just flag the source instead of deleting it?

Please don't insult me.  I am not trying to insult you.

Other than my complaints of censorship, please provide three examples of what you claim was my """"disruptive"""" editing.  Or do you just want to go on with the article from where we are?

This is an example of an unsupported statement in the article that I don't believe is true: """"The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if resolution requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. While this rule creates a double standard"""".  I think this means """"pro se litigants get an unfair advantage"""". Wasn't it you that wrote that?
FYI, I was put in jail  for over 4 months solely for engaging in pro se litigation.  The only way I could get out was to agree to withdraw all pro se litigation. My husband was threatened w jail for paying for me to file a complaint while I was in jail and paying for a typist.  And no, I don't believe there is a a history of """"putting people in jail who think the rules don't apply to them and who can't conform themselves to them.""""  To the best of my knowledge, in civilized countries people are only put in jail for committing crimes and as far as summary contempt use of jail is very limited.  I saw an article, for instance, about a judge who put a whole courtroom in jail for 2 hours because of an objectionable ringing  cell phone.   """,0

Its is common knowledge in South India as to who the Sengunthar/ Kaikolar are and its not my problem if you've been living in a very close knit community or unaware of this.

1. The following is quoted from a legitimate third party website. http://globalindiamissions.org/newsletter/nwsltr0802.htm

The Kaikolan are a large Tamil and Telugu caste of weavers. There are seventy-two subdivisions (nadu or desams). Their name comes from a mythical hero and from the words """"kai"""" (hand) and """"koi"""" (shuttle). They consider the different parts of the loom to represent various gods and sages. They are also known as Sengundar, which means a red dagger, which is traced to the legend of the earth being harassed by demons, which led to the people asking the god Shiva to help them.

Traditionally, one girl in every family was set apart to be dedicated to temple service and becomes a """"Devdasi"""" (meaning female servant of god). In the temple, the girl is considered married to the temple deity but in practice becomes a prostitute, especially to the Brahmans and she learns traditional music and dancing.

2. This is taken from a journal research article with abundant valid references. This is as legitimate as it gets.

This article talks in much detail about how women from the Sengundhar/ Kaikola caste get into the sacred prostitution in temples.

""""Contending identities: Sacred prostitution and reform in colonial South India Priyadarshini Vijaisri A1, A1 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi"""" South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group Issue: Volume 28, Number 3 / December 2005 Pages: 387 - 411

To view the complete article just register, its free.

Here are the links 

http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/link.asp?id=jv31l27518262711 If you cannot access it then just go to the following page and follow one of the links

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q;=Contending+identities%3A+Sacred+prostitution+and+reform+in+colonial+South+India

3. This is taken from another legitimate webiste http://www.go2southasia.org/l_peoples.html of a world renknown organisation recognised by many countries. They have no gain in just picking on the Sengunthar caste.

The KAIKOLAR people are a caste of weavers 1.5 million strong in southern India. They are Hindus and view different parts of the loom as representations of various gods and sages. Traditionally, each Kaikolar family sets aside one daughter to serve in a Hindu temple. That daughter is considered married to the temple deity—often the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. In practice, the daughter becomes a temple prostitute.

All 3 of the above references are quite legitimate and I can quote many more. There is no question of coincidence or any error in any of these sources.

I'm not the """"paid editor"""" to which you referred, but I am gravely concerned by the proposal for a change to the terms of use that describes edits as """"deception"""" and allows anyone to make such accusations against any editor at any time. It is impossible for editors to prove they are *not* receiving some form of benefit. The examples of """"benefit"""" (which the WMF has tried to obfuscate now that some people have noticed the expansiveness of the proposal) includes things like receiving a t-shirt or a meal (any """"money, goods or services""""). Unfortunately, there's a great deal of handwaving about paid editing, but very little evidence that there's any greater bias in edits that are paid for than edits that are not.  A large number of the articles created in the latest paid editing """"scandal"""" are still present, and many that were deleted still easily met our notability standards. There is not a good faith editor who hasn't received some sort of benefit or reward from their work on Wikipedia. Nobody has yet demonstrated that people who are paid do any worse at editing Wikipedia than people who aren't paid.  Meanwhile, there's lots of evidence that people who want to push a point of view will not hesitate to accuse editors of being paid or otherwise having a serious conflict of interest (q.v., the Arbcom archives). The proposal is one more tool in the arsenal for people who are motivated to go after their opponents, and does absolutely nothing at all to improve the project.    """,0

1487,"""It's complicated, but the date of the FIRST composition was almost certainly July, 1785 (a choral version using a male chorus and a """"cantus firmus"""" vocal line), followed by a purely instrumental version in November for the memorial service for the 2 prominent Masons (The Masonic Funeral Music). The July entry had to have been written in November since the event (the deaths/funeral music) was listed along with it. But in Mozart's catalog, he listed the MFM ahead of K.478 which was written in October. That sequence is one of several clues that he wrote it in a month preceeding October. For the category of the month of November, he did not enter the MFM. Why not? Because he wrote the piece in July - at least the CHORAL version. The 2 versions are nearly identical with the choral version essentially being the MFM with a chorus (for the most part). 
I have a copy of Mozart's Thematic Catalog. 
Mozart mistakenly (?) entered K.478 under July also (rather than October), but at least he entered the sequence of the 2 pieces correctly: K.477, K.478. There's other evidence, but it gets very lengthy and complicated. The sequence of those 2 pieces in his catalog plus no mention of the MFM in November should be sufficient evidence that the original music for the MFM was not composed in November. It was just a VERSION of it which was done in November, nearly identical to the first one. He dated the MUSIC correctly, but omitted the first and lesser event of the elevation of a visitng Mason to Master in August. Doing catch-up work on his catalog in November, he listed the more important event: the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers in November for which it was performed again. 

2 events, 1 set of music (essentially), composed prior to K.478, correctly listed under July for a Masonic ceremony in August, but the more important event (the deaths of the 2 Masonic Brothers) accompanied the entry, written in November due to some administrative procrastination on Mozart's part. 

Mozart normally entered the MUSIC only once in his catalog, not repeating an entry if it was essentially the same music for a different Event or purpose. 
In other words, his Thematic Catalog was primarily a book of Music - not Events, even though he also listed the event or person or opera, etc, along with it.
For example, if one of his operas was revived or produced in some city for the first time, he didn't list it again in his catalog. That would be an Event-Driven catalog. 
And in doing catch-up work on his catalog, evidently sometime in November (after November 7th when the 2nd Mason died), he listed the music as having been composed in July, but listed the event as being the deaths of the 2 men.
1 set of music, 2 events, the more important event listed in his catalog.    
His catalog is slightly messed up on that page, but mostly correct, and with pieces listed in the correct sequence - which may have been more important to Mozart than listing the correct date. 

If someone says """"July must be a mistake"""", they need to have their ducks lined up and explain why he listed the MFM prior to an October piece, and why he didn't list it under November. 
The """"mistake"""" theory is a push-button ejection seat, in some cases, and carried to extremes, one could claim that Beethoven wrote the MFM, with scholars mistakenly believing that it was Mozart's handwriting on the score and in the catalog. 
If """"July"""" was a mistake, prove it. 
I think July is correct, and there's a great deal of evidence to back it up - the first piece of evidence being that Mozart said so in his catalog.

 Symbolism of resignation date

Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.

Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs

If Wikipedia decides to semi-protect or totally protect a generic conceptual confusion, then stupidity must have reached its top. Worse than that can it not become. An encyclopedia that guards total conceptual confusion with all its forces must be a world and historical record of stupidity. Can the editors of Wikipedia really agree on protection of conceptual confusion, like, """"yes, the article about clade is a mess and we protect this mess. We also protect propagation of this mess into other concepts in this encyclopedia. We do not allow any resolving contribution of this confusion anywhere in this encyclopedia. It is a cladistic encyclopedia. We like conceptual messes"""". Such protection would at least be typically cladistic. (Take care, because cladistics does actually deny that 1=1).

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.

The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.  

(and I want to add)

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.

 RE: Academics  

The below section under """"Academics"""" as written:

It should be noted that Irvington High School was once not a school with high academic achievements. It has been said that the sole reason for Irvington's recent development in that category is the transfer of students from Weibel Elementary School. However, while it's obvious Weibel Elementary School has made a positive change on Irvington's test scores, Weibel Elementary School is only a small portion of Irvington's students. A much greater possibility is that students from other schools served as examples, and the inspiration was enough to raise Irvington's academic achievement. 

The above passaage is bias and speculative, and should warrant a citation. Student from Weibel Elementary School do not, nor cannot feed directly into Irvington High School. As is the case in any public school system in the United States, unless a student is gifted, elementry school students matriculate into a junior high or middle school, than they move onto high school. 

I recommend that this whole section be stricken. I attended Irvington High School in the early 1990's and the differnece between the Weible neighborhood of Fremont and Irvington disctrict is very little. Both are middle to upper middle class, with the housing tracks in Weibel being slightly newer than the older housing track of Irvington district. While the Weibel neighborhood benefited from the high tax revenues of other parts of mission san jose district, very little seperates the two area other than a larger working class population in the Irvington district as a result of the pre-silcon valley economies in which many autoworkers from Genreal Motors in Fremont, Peterbuilt, Trail Mobile, and Caterpillar in Newark,Ca, and Ford Motors in Milpitas,CA resided in the Irvington district. However, as Unionized laborers these workers made a good wage for the time, maybe as well of a living as those currently in the Weibel neighborhood given inflation and cost of living in California of the 1970's and 1980's. 

If this section should stay it should speak rather to the major re-organzation that took place in the middle to late 90's under the leadership of Principal Gaskill and Vice-Principal (current Principal) Pete Murchison (check spelling). As all of the accolades currently enjoyed by IHS were earned prior the the FUSD reorganization which placed the Weibel neighborhood  in the IHS service area. This can easily be verifyed by crossing the early state-wide and national honors Irvington High School earned in the mid-1990's. Thus, de-bunking the assertion that Weibel neighborhood elemtry school students are responsible for the academic excellence of IHS.""",0

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. 

Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. 

“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’”

Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time """"mother tongue"""" and """"most frequently used language"""" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the """"mother tongue"""" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about """"Orthodox Chams""""). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.

There are published books (in Greece - by leftist Greek journalists and amateur historians) that refer to figures around 200k (or even more for that matter) for Slavomacedonian speakers in Greece (again based on some dubious definition); large agenda-driven figures can also be found for Vlachs and Arvanites - since FPS, Taivo and Jim62sch and the rest of the gang are such experts on Greece I leave it as an exercise to them to locate these sources and at least put a fig leaf on. Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.""",0

Copyvios on MP again

G'day SandyGeorgia. I thought you might be interested that I pulled an article from the main page today (T:ITN) that was a copyvio from start to finish: 2010 Colombia floods. It had been up for days and the copyvios were then when it was posted. I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big """"plagiarism on the main page"""" discussion. I thought you might be interested as I recall you were one of the main drivers of that discussion. If it's still ongoing, I'd be happy to join in. I've written a little rant/essay on the bottom of my userpage about my frustrations with the lack of main page scrutiny.  
 Hi, Mk I've also taken a few days off, and am ever-so-slowly catching up; starting at the bottom of the page is as good a place as any!  I actually did not intend to become a """"main driver"""" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become """"Plagiarism Central"""", but alas and alack, so it has turned out )  What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the """"reward culture"""" on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has.  Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at DYK or ITN (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle.   On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history.  You might want to go through those steps as well.   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously.   (Talk) """,0

I did check out the article on Kaziranga National Park.

For example, the subsection on Fauna is linked to a larger and more detailed article on the fauna of this national park. Another example is the article on Buckingham Palace. The subsection on The Garden and the Mews has a Main link to an article specifically dealing with the Buckingham Palace garden. In Sustainability, this is not the case, and there is often redundancy: for example, Main link points to acid rain and climate change when in fact that subsection already has those articles embedded in the text. 

The book is Principles of Sustainability, by Simon Dresner, 2002. The paperback is coming next month, but the hardback should be easy to get thru the library.

Montalban is quite right - I have supported the inclusion of opposition arguments in this article, particularly from an Orthodox perspective.  And quite a body of material has been gathered that meets that objective. However, from a readability viewpoint, the article had become cumbersome to the point of unuseability. I have repeatedly requested Montalban to recognise this fact and to take measures to address it that would retain the arguments while improving the reading experience. It is for that reason that I have refrained from comment in this article for a long time now in the hope that this holy peace would bear fruit. I have been disappointed in this hope. With the creation of the other article, the imperative to have all the material in this particular article became less obvious. Given Montalban's obduracy, I finally lent my suport to a radical solution - the wholesale transport of sections to that other article. I'm prepared to see the ongoing presence of the core of the Orthodox argument in this article on the understanding that most of the heavy lifting should continue to be done by the """"See main"""" to the other article. This assumes tat other editors will nt litter the remaining skeleton aerguments with """"references"""" or """"says who"""" flag requests. A more reasonable, less absolutist position by Montalban might have moved me to less radical surgury.   """,0

The war criminals cat is generally a difficult one to consider NPOV is many situations.

1.) The Federal Governemnt does not automatically repay any loan deficiency, a lender can file to have any deficiency paid them via the Federal Government i.e. the FHA reserves the right to pay or not pay any shortfall

2.) These loans are extemely expensive for seniors and until regulated or limited more heavily I think they should be avoided i.e. upfront costs are absolutely too high!

3.) You may get 60% to 70% of your equity in monthly installments / payments but, you are also loosing equity in that the interest (you are not paying) is compounded on the back of the loan.  Interested is paid on the principal balance (growing each month) but also compounded on top of interest on top of interest.  So, when you get to the end of the loan you may have given up 30% to 40% of your homes equity to obtain a fraction in a monthly payout / installment.  It would be wise for seniors to sell instead of taking on this risky loan program.

4.) Seniors / borrowers of Reverse Mortgages also get hit with a monthly fee.

I think the pitfalls need to be clearly listed here so that seniors can see all the facts.  The fact is that they are only givin' the positives.",0

1910,"""== Early Chicago computer club ==
Hi, thanks for all your efforts!!!

Not sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page. 

AFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange. 

I believe there was a meeting approx Apr '75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a """"Digital Systems"""" original 8080 """"box"""" - and the CP/M operating system.  

(Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it). 

The """"hobby"""" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. 

[Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).  

SO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked. 

MY involvement with the club was to be an """"active participant"""" in that for ex. I was sec'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system. 

My home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to """"produce outputs that matched that timing"""", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)

My machine also  once """"video"""" became available (I skipped the """"TV Typewriter"""" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first). 

THEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don't recall now.)

I modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The """"Tarbell"""" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the """"CACHE Cassette Operating System"""" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.  

SO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the """"boards"""" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a """"board"""" - I think so and the little Sinclair """"pocket calculator"""" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.  

When the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought """"this is the end of the hobby"""".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a """"built"""" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I'm sure the """"Hams"""" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to """"talk over the air""""..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much """"burned out"""" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area. 

____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?  

Just to """"come to a better close""""  the fact I'd done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to """"beep"""" things back and forth with friends; 

Then the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be """"by committee"""" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by  (talk • contribs)

 Portuguese Empire 
One cannot credibly claim that the Portuguese Empire began in 1415 with the take over of what ended up being a relatively worthless North African port (Ceuta).  It is consensus that the modern imperial era began with the """"discovery"""" of the Americas by Columbus, 77 years after the capture of Ceuta, which was nothing more than a hop over the straits of Gibraltar for the Portuguese taken for comercial purpose, NOT for empire.  

If the capture of Ceuta in 1415 is to be held as the starting date of the Portuguese Empire, using the same logic, we would then have to (absurdly) argue that the Spanish Empire began with the Castilian conquest of the Canary Islands in 1402.  The Canary Islands were subject to the same colonial pressures that would later characterize European colonization in the Americas (large numbers of colonists with subjugated natives and the overlay of the conquering culture over the conquered one).  Ceuta has much more in common with the Canarian conquest than with a truly imperial expansion.  

Therefore, just as the Spanish Empire began when Columbus landed in the Americas and not with the 1402 take over of the Canary Islands, by the same logic, the Portuguese Empire began with the landing of Cabral in Brazil in 1500, not in some minor North African port in 1415.

Moreover, because I won't give this editor sources to support his position that I oppose his work, I am somehow inferior an my every attempt perceived as a """"red herring.""""  

The user clearly has established himself as the canine pack's alpha male (or herself as the alpha bitch)...

I have my own talk page if you want to ask me something, asking me on someone else's is ridiculous. Why can't you use """"Though historians disagree""""? Because you haven't supplied a strong reliable sources showing there is disagreement on the status of Punch. That's why. The article already reflects that historians disagree about when the institution of slavery was started, so no, I'm not opposed to it as long as it's properly sourced and is accurately reflected in the article. To use that language in regards to Punch's status or the significance of his court case is a violation of WP:NPOV and WP:OR. Like I've been saying from the beginning, find a reliable source and then the article can properly include that source. Like I've told you before, feel free to take this to dispute resolution if you want. I would, but you've made so many numerous red herring arguments that I wouldn't want you to suddenly feign ignorance and pretend that you never argued such a thing. So pick the argument or assertion you want, and take it to the proper noticeboard. Also, I didn't reference plagiarism at all. You're the only one who fallaciously made such an accusation. I've only said that emails are often not verifiable and don't count as a reliable source. Please make a stronger effort in reading comprehension before levying accusations...egregious accusations.

A person can only take so many of these types of allegations before he begins to believe the attacker is serious.  

Enter mens rea.

Inasmuch as I have been found guilty of the crime by this judge (and jury of one), I've the liberty and license, now,  to respond befittingly.

The only accurate way to assess the opinions of a large group of scientists is to poll them, as every researcher does not necessarily believe every word in a study they participate in.

The purpose of this spelling was to erase the linkage that the Romanian national movement was trying to install with the Daco-Romans, the ancient people who came to be after the Roman invasion to modern Romania. No one, except perhaps to Hungarian nationalists, uses it today, but it still remains in some important and reliable history books. So would you use that spelling just because it existed in many books during the early 20th century? 

Likewise, the term """"Palestine"""" for the """"holyland"""" was used by Romans after the Jewish revolt and their explosion, and much later, it was adopted by the British and consequentially, by the Arab national movement in Palestine/Eretz Israel. As stated above by Breein1007, the use of the term in old books (when there was no political entity there yet, and when there was no one to fix the mistake) doesn't justify using it today. It's no justified because it's an historical distortion, and it's not justified because it's a distortion used to manipulate people into accepting an Arab-Palastinian narrative. Well, feel free to project your political stances, but not in a definition of Hummus. 

If I were to replace """"Israel"""" with """"Palestine"""" that would have not only been an anachronism (for 4,000 years ago it was not known as Israel), but it would also be a politically inclined decision (although in even more ancient history books, like, say, the bible, the term """"Israel"""" is widely used to describe parts of modern Israel and the Palestinian Authority). You're hiding behind a supposable academic and scientific argument to instill your narrative, which I have no doubt seems very academic and scientific to you.

Now that I'm unblocked, I can post my reply to you.

You are again using the same tactics you used a few weeks ago, in an apparent effort to censor me, and to prevent me from trying to improve this page by adding more credible information.

Immediately after challenging me this last time, you had me blocked so that I could not respond.  One wonders what you are afraid of. You appear to fit the profile of those who use sneaky maneuvers to block people or to otherwise prevent edits containing information you disagree with, from ever seeing the light of day on Wikipedia. As reported on CNN and ABC last month, these tactics are why Wikipedia has been attacked so much lately, and why it's being taken less and less seriously as time goes on.  Such behavior is slowly turning Wikipeidia into a bit of a joke, and has helped diminish it's once significant potential for good.

Your attempts at censorship reminds one of the scene in a movie years ago where a person who was about to be exposed on the front pages of their local newspaper, got up early the morning it was to be delivered, and ran through their neighborhood picking up all their neighbors' papers, in the misplaced belief that their neighbors would never learn the truth that was on the front page of that morning's paper.

Interestingly, rather than trying to support your allegations of danger and harmfulness with solid facts and evidence, you and others who share a common point of view that poppers are bad, continue to attack those who actually possess a high level of knowledge about these compounds. If you don't like what people with whom you do not agree try to post, rather than debating from a position of solid facts and underlying supporting documentation, you try to 'shoot the  messenger'.

For example, in addition to your maneuvers to block me and prevent me from replying to your attacks or to post edits with accurate and clarifying information on nitrites/poppers, you attack me by implying that my screen name, 'Allabout' means I sell poppers.

You are wrong.

You also imply that I  am """"associated with http://www.allaboutpoppers.com/"""".

Again, you are wrong. 

However, I happen to agree with those who say that the 'All About Poppers' site contains a great deal of credible information, supported with solid evidence. I've spent a great deal of time reading the site, and digging into the information presented there. I know of other similarly credible popper sites, as well.  Would you say I am """"associated"""" with them, too?

As the record clearly shows, over the past few weeks, you and others (Some of whom may be one in the same, perhaps using proxy servers to mask true identities to try to avoid being charged with sock puppetry),  have engaged in an ongoing effort to prevent myself and others, with whom you do no agree on the subject of nitrites and poppers, from contributing to this page with some of our knowledge.  That is wrong, and you know it. (I note that, today, you have somehow successfully removed/erased the history that was showing up on the site's 'history' page. This history showed the """"summary"""" comments for various edits.  It now appears you've allowed it back  in.)

You say, """"just tell me: If this is all wrong and misleading......."""".

I have not said """"this is all wrong and misleading"""". There is information on this page which is accurate, and there's information on this page which is not accurate.  But, when someone who is knowledgeable makes an effort to correct the inaccuracies on the page, they have been attacked with ongoing and relentless efforts to try to prevent their edits from remaining on the page. The record is very clear in that regard. (Again, as anyone can see, you have removed or erased the history for this page up until two reverts you did late on Jan 4, 2006)

You ask me """"why did you use this disclaimer"""". 

I wondered if those of you who have put up such a resistance to having more accurate information posted on this nitrites/poppers page, might have some personal hang ups or prejudices about some of the people whom they perceive as primarily using poppers recreationally. Are you homophobic?  Opposed to consenting adults making informed decisions about whether or not to have fun and take pleasure from something you may not agree with?  Anti-drug crusaders? Feel obliged to fight """"sin"""" and """"pleasure"""" wherever you find it, perhaps based on some deeply held religious beliefs? Or simply just believe that if you give people information, no matter how accurate it may be, that might indicate poppers may not be as harmful as some would like us to believe, that people will flock to them, and that somehow the end of the world will appear?  Much as in """"Reefer Madness""""?

The disclaimer was meant to try to appease those fears.  Unlik",0

Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

WhoMe's new introduction

After the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  

Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. —  (comment)  

Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:
a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox
b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU
c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this
d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently
e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.
I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  

Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  

I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  

I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)

Reactions from San Diegans
After the format move to 570, many who live in the San Diego area had complained that they were unable to get the station's new signal, fueling the complaint that AM 570 had """"Los Angeles-ized"""", and no longer catered to San Diego's sports teams and listeners.

This also came to the attention of Premiere Radio Networks, Jim Rome's syndicator; XEPRS-AM, """"the Mighty 1090,"""" a rival radio station that broadcasts in San Diego and parts of Orange County and Los Angeles (and run by the Broadcast Company of the Americas, whose CEO John Lynch administered XTRA Sports Radio in San Diego from the mid 1980s to its merger with 1150 in 2002), picked up The Jim Rome Show in September 2005. 

As the radio flagship home of the Los Angeles Lakers, KLAC normally put much more emphasis and focus on the team, possibly very much to the chagrin of listeners who are not supporters of the Lakers.

 Just saw your post a minute ago. I haven't had any time to look at Wikipedia in a while. You're quite correct. I defer to your more extensive fund of information on AK politics. I'm not sure why Sharon wasted her filing fee. There has been zero campaign, reflected in the lack of traction. Phone messages left for her after her announcement and e-mail both went unanswered. I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, """"None of the above"""" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea. I thought you were a Washington State radio person or a punk rock band -). Given her name recognition, I expect she might win the primary if the party doesn't put out a mailer for Matt.   

Now, on to Gabrielle LeDoux.  Once again, big gaping holes which require addressing.  First, Kurt LeDoux ran for Kodiak's Senate seat in 1982 as a Democrat, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Bob Mulcahy.  Gabrielle LeDoux was herself a Democrat for many years, including originally filing as such in 2004 before switching to the Republicans at the last minute.  

 I didn't realize she had switched. I haven't paid much attention to Kodiak since Zharoff left office. I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  

Second, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  

 Thanks for all your input. Please feel free to change or add.  I doh't have any ownership in Sharon's page.   

 """"Carpetbagger"""" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   """,0
2113,"As far as Muslims are concerned any criticism of Islam is hate speech. I have been a Muslim for five years and know perfectly the hatred that Muslims have for apostates and the level of intolerance towards their critics. Been there, done that myself, without even being aware of it. It all seemed normal to do. Today I find myself on the other side of the fence. Quoting opinions contrary to those believed by Muslims is not hate speech. The Quran is filled with hate speech. Look at the article Ali Sina for example: that is hate speech. The very language is despiteful. My every contribution to Islamofascims, Islamofobia and Ali Sina are removed. The only reason is because they are not in agreement with Islamic creed. We must not allow Wikipedia to be converted into an Islamic tool of propaganda. Both views must be expressed equally. Take the example of Sina’s page. There we have six comments made by anonymous Muslims calling him all names including a mischievous liar, a rabid anti Islamist, Islamophobe, etc. In the paragraph that said “Ali Sina is a controversial personality” I quoted an example of how diverse are the opinions of Sina’s fans from those of his foes.  This is not to agree with those opinions. Muslims resisted this example tooth and nail, with all inane and invalid excuses. I made it clear that this is not an endorsement of those views and the notability of the people making those allegations or praises are not important. They are just a sample of what people say about him. It goes from one extreme to another. I think both examples should be stated so the claim that he is a controversial is supported with these examples. Why Muslims do not want to have any mention of what Sina’s fans say about him and only the insults of his foes are mentioned? Any fool will see this article is written by people with an axe to grind against it subject. 
Since I joined Wikipedia, every contribution I made was removed and reverted and incidentally those who removed them were invariably Muslims. Am I not allowed to put the two together and conclude that this is Islamic zealotry at work? OceanSplash13.Dec. 2005 18:20",0

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President of the United stat",0

Thai film list
Over at the , I ran into a problem with the box being too long and it was running into the year heading for the 1920s films. So I changed the map image to one that was horizontal. I think the svg locator-map renderings are more appropriate. They have been made for every country, are a standard size and easier to discern than the satellite images. It's something to consider  not that I'm trying to add to your workload. I was just having a problem with the Thai film list, and that's the solution I came up with. I hope you understand. However, these locator maps might also prove to be workable for the regional cinema templates that contain the soon-to-be-deleted film reel image, if only just temporarily until a more """"filmy"""" image is located.

Oh, thanks for adding the Tony Jaa photo to Cinema of Thailand. It was one I took a couple of years ago, and is out of focus. I've never liked it that much, but uploaded it out of desperation when I had nothing else. I moved it  lower on the page and added a caption. My favorite photo so far is the one of the Siam Theater marquee when it was playing The Tin Mine, and the marquee was Thai characters. That, to me, is the cinema of Thailand, literally. I try to take my camera to press preview events when I get the chance.

My comment above is only *explanation*.

Sigh. Here again is what I want to put in the article. It's on my talk page. Sigh:

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword""""; confusion about the derivation of """"Shotokan"""" may occur otherwise. The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

You say that you do not *agree* with this, but you cannot seem to explain what is *wrong* with it. It would make no claim whatsoever, when posted in the article, to any reasonable person, that the """"short sword"""" story is being told out there (even though it is; I just don't have it in a book for you, so I'm not trying to claim it on Wikipedia).

""""1. Not to be confused with shoto meaning """"short sword"""". The Kanji for shoto, """"pine waves"""", is (松涛). The first character is (松), which means pine tree. The second character (涛) is a kanji variant of (濤), which means large wave. The Kanji for shoto, short sword, is (小刀). The first character is (小), meaning small, and the second character is (刀), meaning blade. Any literate Japanese reader who saw """"松涛"""" would not mistake it.""""

I think it's reasonable of me to dispute not showing the Kanji and it's reasonable of me to dispute not having that first sentence that basically says """"Note that this use of shotodoes not mean """"short sword""""."""" If you want to put in that sentence rather than """"Not to be confused with..."""" that would be fine with me.  08:32""",0

I want to report  for erasing the research material I have included when supporting one of the projects ERASED by him in this page.

I encourage talk to finally provide to the WP community the supporting material for the inclusion of this project here. He is the one that systematically forces the inclusion of this project; it has to be him who knows and proves to the community the value of the mentioned project.

I want to report  as a biased editor whose behavior could be very well understood under the terms of WP:COI.

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens. Rushton and Jensen derive the figure of a 3.44 IQ point gain by adding data from four excludes tests to Table A1 while Flynn and Dickens' figure of a 5.5 IQ gain for black Americans was derived from Figure 3 in the study.[34]""""

And by thw way, the reason I didn't to sign my username was because I forgot. Sorry.  4:10 (UTC)

I just wanted to let you know that I've being doing some sluthing on IQ. Here's what I found out: 
1. I e-mailed Public Relations of IQ. I was told that they are signed to Bungalo/Universal, but are having a hard time with the labels.  is their record label, but they are mysteriously not on the roster.  The artists on Bungalo are Carl Thomas, LaToya Jackson, Suga Free, Patti LaBelle, Rodney Jerkins among others. Universal is linked with Bungalo. Bungalo released the girls' debut album, Roll Call.
2. IQ are on Radio Disney's Incubator roster (http://radio.disney.go.com/music/incubator/IQ_bio.html), which would mean that the girls are currently playing on a national radio station.
3. The girls did (and are) on a tour. The tour has mainly been around Massachusetts, but they did tour Los Angeles and New York City. 

I'm not sure if this fits for notability, but if doesn't, then that's okay. If they do, then give me the okay for the article. Take care!  3:41 (UTC)

This is a reminder that when a WP:PROD tag is removed, even by the creator of an article, it should not be added back for any reason.  Doing so is inappropriate.  WP:PROD is meant for only uncontroversial deletions.  If you still think this article should be deleted, you should send it to WP:AFD.  juicetalk

Just a friendly reminder to use an edit summary when proposing deletion for an article.  Edit summary usage is always good, but it is especially important that edit summaries are used when proposing deletion.  The reason for this is that articles proposed for deletion that later have the  tag removed should not be proposed for deletion again, but rather sent to Wikipedia:Articles for deletion.  The only easy way to check if an article was previously proposed for deletion is to look at the edit history and the edit summaries people have left before.  Thanks!  juicetalk

Please leave messages that need to be read on Tony Sidaway's talk page

This bot is approved and doesn't need a flag.  Except for tests, it's inactive.

The software it runs is called .  It's open source (BSD license) and written in compiled Chicken Scheme.

Purpose
This is to be a general purpose query engine for English Wikipedia, using a simple functional programming interface to permit queries of varying complexity to be performed, and the results delivered to a nominated page in the user's userspace and, optionally, sent to the user's enabled email address.

Query language
The query language is based on scheme, a dialect of the lisp family.  If you can write a simple lisp expression you can query this bot.

Typical query functions will look like:

 (whatlinkshere PAGE)
 Produces a list of pages that link to the page.
 (editorsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]]))
 Produces a list of unique usernames and IP numbers identifying all editors of the page
 (editsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits to the page
 (editsby USERNAME/IP [datetime-since [datetime-to]])
 Produces a list of edits by the user
 (apply EXPR [PAR...] LIST)
 Applies the single expression, with optional parameters, to the list
 (map EXPR [PAR...] [LIST...])
 Maps the single expression, with optional parameters, to the each member of the list.
 (list [EXPR...])
 Composes a list of the expressions
 (email EXPR)
 Sends the result of evaluating the expression in email.  The result will also appear on the wiki.

Using the bot
To register to use the bot, you must edit the bulleted list of usernames at User:TonyBot/Users to add a link to a page in your userspace.  If you simply add your userpage (User:Example), then TonyBot will use the page User:Example/TonyBot to communicate with you.  If you add another page in your userspace, then it will use that page instead of User:Example/TonyBot.

To make a query, edit your TonyBot page to add the query.  TonyBot will execute the query and edit your TonyBot page to provide a link to a page containing the results.  This will be at User:TonyBot/Example/N where N is a numeric value which has meaning only to the bot.

Limitations
 Queries that take too long to execute may be stopped before completion
 Queries that are judged too complex will be rejected
 Queries that return very large volumes of data may be rejected or cut short.

The value of """"too long"""", """"too complex"""" and """"very large"""" may vary over time in an unpredictable way.

Conditions of use
This bot is an experimental service and is provided as-is.  Queries are run at the discretion of the bot operator and subject to the operational requirements of Wikipedia's services.  It may be subject to unplanned outages, and may disappear without warning, at the discretion of the operator and subject to the wishes of the community.

All queries must be made by registered Wikipedia users, in public, on the wiki.  The bot owner reserves the right, for good reason and with the interests of Wikipedia in mind, to refuse access to any user.  The reason for refusal will be stated publicly on the user's talk page and may be subject to revision if you can somehow successfully cajole, persuade or provide reasonable reassurances.

What does that have to do with anything? What does that even mean? Lit reviews cover ALL kinds of papers, both those which reached similar conclusions and those which reached different conclusions. That's scholarship. Unlike the present state of this article where only sources which reach a particular conclusion are included.

{{unblock|1=
Ruslik0 is incorrect in his block of me. I wasn't edit waring as defined by Wikipedia: I made one reversion of an edit today.

Furthermore, Ruslik0 is incorrect that I made a false accusation regarding the objective fact that Jeffro77 is engaging in vandalism: Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals). The Wikipedia article on the Omega Point Theory lists seven different mainstream peer-reviewed scientific journals in which Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been published (and that's not including the Zygon journal). That is quite a significant amount.

I understand, for example and contrary to most spaniards, morocco's claim on western sahara. Firstly, the saharaouis are very few and their independence would clearly have been the result of european colonialism of the maghreb and algerian expansionism in the region. I understand how countries which have been subjected to the humiliation of colonialism feel, their borders being decided by foreign powers, and i believe that the polisario should take their people out of the horrendous conditions they live in in the camps of Tindouf and move back to their land.

As I've already written above, I oppose placing Gibson's bio in the 'Anti-Semitic People' category because he vigorously denies the charge and listing him as such, without qualification, is tantamount to calling him a liar.  Anti-Semitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge, and Wikipedia should categorically label a person as anti-Semitic only in cases where the person either admits to being anti-Semitic or admits to holding unquestionably anti-Semitic views.  Gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges.  I do, however, sympathize with people who continue to add the 'anti-Semitic People' tag to his page. I therefore propose the creation of a new category called 'People accused of anti-Semitism'. The category would be for people who face (or have faced) substantiated charges of anti-Semitism from respected sources.  """"Substantiated charges"""" would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge (as opposed to a """"my best friend's roommate told me"""" accusation), and """"respected sources"""" would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating anti-Semitism (civil rights organizations like ADL and SPLC come to mind).  This new category would allow Wikipedia to associate the anti-Semitism controversy with Gibson's article without actually leveling the charge that he is anti-Semitic.  Thoughts?

First, trying to pull """"rank"""" with me, is not an effective way to be persusive with me or to appear as an ally or friendly. Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something """"wrong"""" with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such """"warnings"""" around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to """"hide"""" them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such """"warnings"""" represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its """"Good Article"""" subject matter relates. First and foremost, such good articles serve to refute the rampant misinformation in the minds of the average populace.  21:17, 17 September 2006.""",0

Responses:
1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.
2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.
3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish. I did review the situation with a sitting Arbcom member before starting RFA, as you are aware.
4 - This is the first time I have heard about it. It seems a bit late to be digging this up now.
5 - I know nothing about this, your page was not even on my watch-list until today.
6 - No, I was not even aware of """"revenge nominations"""". If I ever commented in a DR related to this, it was not as part of any pattern and I do not recall ever doing so. I do not watch everything you do on Commons, nor did I watch everything Russavia did. I am not Russavia, nor do I take responsibility for his actions. If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

Your 7 responses appear to avoid the central issue, which is how you are now using Wikipediocracy to hound me. You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. If you have allegations to make, please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then I can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.

Again, you are digging through history, some of which is 7 years old and the most recent is now 3 years old. It would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud, most of which I have forgotten as I have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Smile! 


Smile a little, smile a little, all along the road;
Every life must have its burden, every heart its load.
Why sit down in gloom and darkness with your grief to sup?
As you drink Fate's bitter tonic, smile across the cup.

Smile upon the troubled pilgrims whom you pass and meet;
Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms, oft for weary feet.
Do not make the way seem harder by a sullen face;
Smile a little, smile a little, brighten up the place.

Smile upon your undone labour; not for one who grieves
O'er his task waits wealth or glory; he who smiles achieves.
Though you meet with loss and sorrow in the passing years,
Smile a little, smile a little... even through your tears!

Hi Myrdred,

The best way to move articles is to use the Move link on the left-hand side of the page.  Cutting and pasting the text of articles from one to another only moves the text; it does not move the edit history.  Fragmenting the edit history is both a nuisance and a legal issue, because when we don't provide a list of all contributors to an article, we are violating the GNU Free Documentation License.

Here, from the talk page, three other editors confirming my judgment of just how """"embarassing"""" the current article is, and which contributes to the common conception among academics that Wikipedia is primarily written by intellectually disabled kindergartners and high-school dropouts on a power-trip: 
'm sorry but the introduction is an embarrassingly crass articulation of what Heidegger's project is about. It is embarrassing and needs to be fixed!

I agree, especially with sources. From what I understand of Heidegger, the three paragraphs in the introduction are roughly accurate, but they require edits to become smooth and easily understandable. But most importantly, there are no references!! I find the biography and following subjects are for the most part thoroughly cited, but the intro is not? I will keep my eye out for references, but anyone who is knowledgable and wellread on the subject should consider adding references to the introduction. Jdanbeck (talk) 
I'd say the second paragraph is inaccurate, and in fact absolute nonsense. It neither reflects Heidegger's position, nor is coherent in itself. There used to be a decent intro. Revert to it? KD Tries Again (talk) KD Tries Again

And then, have a look at the fact that 4 editors supported me, before a single WIKILAWYER arrived at the scene, to mass delete. How exactly can I """"lose"""" an argument about Heidegger by calling you Hitler? Whether or not you or I or anyone is an idiot or a Nazi or whatever has no reflection on whether or not the current article ACTIVELY SPREADS MISINFORMATION, as I have repeatedly stated and showed.

Hence, Congressional relocation funding. So, the bottom line was money, and questionnable technical feasibility. The study is probably cited in the hearings for the funding legislation.
Keep in mind there are hundreds of miles of old underground mines under Centralia, too deep to strip mine from the surface, too many surface openings to plug, and the smoke and steam are lethal to humans and other living things. That's why people needed to be relocated: living in Centralia is hazardous to one's health. And when coal is burned, it loses 90% of its mass, so the ground above often subsides, opening new pathways for air to enter and fuel the fires. There have long been reports of more people living there than should be, possibly including some who were paid to leave.

This comes frot the root نصر (naṣara) meaning 'help' or 'make victorious' (interestingly, in derived form II it means 'Christianize'). Therefore, منصور (manṣūr) means 'helped', 'supported', 'victorious'. The place name is the feminine version of this, perhaps representing the old accusative (with locative meaning). In Arabic, many place names begin with the definite article. Sometimes the article is kept in trasliteration and sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's transliterated as Al and sometimes it's El. The word itself could be transliterated as Mansura, Mansoura, Mansoora, Mansurah, Mansourah, Mansoorah, Mansureh, Mansoureh, Mansooreh. It would make sense to have all of these alternatives, with and without alternatives of definite article, linking to a disambiguation page. However, the Egyptian Mansurah is by far the most important of these, so it might take precedence over the disambig. I'll see if I can tidy it up a little. —",0

How much money was exchanged for this interview? And was this interview constructed to conflict prison officer Pascoe's claim that he fired a shot that killed Hodson? In the opinion of this nun, Ryan no longer wanted to live. But this nun was not a psychologist, so how could she possibly come to that conclusion?  
Obviously, it seems Ryan's execution was more of a state-assisted suicide. 
In relation to this alleged confession, Ryan didn't actually say he shot Hodson, but allegedly, said he shot to wing not to kill. Ryan,  obviously in an extremely confused mental state, (as any person would be prior to being killed by the Government), could have been talking about his past kangaroo shooting events or any other event for that matter. After all, a mentally confused person does not talk in a rational manner. 
Besides, nobody else close to Ryan claimed he no longer wanted to live. None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing. In any case, any person who states they no longer wish to live should be immediately evaluated for mental illness, So, why wasn't a psychiatrist called to treat Ryan for possible mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts? Why the push to execute Ryan if he was mentally unstable, hence, no longer wanted to live?
Legal professionals will confirm that alleged confessions and alleged verbals are not legally acceptable as """"evidence of guilt"""". Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In Ryan's case there was none - nothing! To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals.
Why would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder"""" In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death.

2466,"""I just read this article for the first time yesterday and I agree that the language in this article is not encyclopedic in tone. It made me laugh out loud in several places, and it's probably not supposed to. Even if the sources use this kind of language, it is not considered the best writing practices and can be vastly improved. For example,

 Why would Nelson's legitimate children be singled out in a box? Why in the section titled """"Children"""", would the ones sired out of wedlock not be included, as in the one he had with Georgeanne Crewe? Why actually have an entire section on his children? Why not just a paragraph? Or actually, they are mentioned in other places, so why the entire section to emphasize them? 
 Why is Kris Nelson described as """"making love"""" with Ron Reagan, but Nelson is described as """"cavorting"""" with two LA Rams cheerleaders in the same paragraph? These euphemisms need to be replaced by the simplest term: """"having sex"""".
 """"She was hell-bent on taking everything she possibly could and leaving Rick ruined."""" Good gracious, this needs a quote from a biographer or something: According to biographer John Q. Gossipmonger...
 I agree that too much is written about Nelson's volatile relationships. I don't see how it has any bearing on his career or notability in performing.
 Why is it necessary to know that Blair was a cocaine-user, shoplifter, and Nelson's family disapproved of their relationship? What bearing does this have on how readers should understand why he was notable? I'm not saying the details about his various affairs should be hidden, but the article makes it seem as if, perhaps like Hugh Hefner, Ricky Nelson was *as notable* for his affairs as he was the job that made him famous. Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson's has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons. If, in fact, the best reliable sources assert that Nelson's affairs actually were as important as his performing career, a quote about that statement should come from a very good source. 

I wrote Roy Orbison's article, and I understand the issue above about sources writing about the """"juicy"""" parts of the subject's life. One of the biographies I used was rather determined to place undue and frankly odd emphasis on the writer's view that Orbison was a hapless underachiever who tripped into fame by accident, and the book is designed to paint him as a mediocre guy in extraordinary circumstances. Orbison's life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson's (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident. So what to do as a Wikipedia editor? Weed out that wtf? in the biography and stick only to the facts.

I'm not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it; the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all Islamic countries.

If you read the article it states that  """"A half-dozen schools, besides Notre Dame, are outstanding,"""" the half dozen are Georgetown, Holy Cross Fordham, St. Loius, Boston College, and Catholic University.  They listed other schools as """"A number of other Catholic schools fall into the mass-production or good-small categories""""  This is where St. John's was listed.  I will correct the statement """"Time also considered St. John's as one of the best Catholic universities in the nation"""" since the statement is incorrect.  24.239.153.58  
I read the article very carefully before adding the information. The premise of the article is """"top Catholic schools,"""" and while it does not explicitly say """"St. John's University is one of the top Catholic schools in the nation,"""" it implies that if there were a list, St. John's would be on it.

I think the 1st paragraph of the section is ok (about how the film's not meant to be realistic), as are the last 3 (self lacing shoes, hoverboards and the Cubs); but I'm beginning to think the discussion of what it did and didn't get right should be removed entirely.

2526,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0

 Temple of Diana 

Quote from """"Pre-Norman cathedral"""" section: """"Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, in alignment with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster..."""".

Nonsense - Geoffrey did NOT make such a claim. The idea that (following the persecution of Christians by Diocletian) Apollo was worshipped at Westminster and Diana in London comes from the history of Westminster Abbey by John Flete, 15th-century monk of Westminster - and he didn't say that Diana was worshipped on the site of St Paul's. That comes from William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586. Camden puts forward the theory that a Roman Temple of Diana had once stood on the site of St Paul's. His evidence is not accepted by modern archaeologists. 

And if the """"in alignment with"""" phrase actually means what it says, one can only respond that a straight line can indeed be drawn between any two points!

Since the sentence about Geoffrey of Monmouth is unreferenced and unverifiable (as well as untrue) I'm simply going to delete it pro tem - unless someone can provide the essential reference to a verifiable source.

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

Also, this is consistent with how the length contrast on the preceding vowel is marked in other surroundings (e.g. in the cited table in """"knot"""").

With regard to """"nod"""", I think there is nothing wrong. It is pretty much the point of Silverman's article that in this particular position, de-voicing is common. Of course, additional sources would be nice.   🙈🙉🙊 """,0

I think there is a confusion about what the LDS project tag means. It doesn't mean or imply that this is directly connected to the church, that there is an official relationship or anything of the sort. It doesn't even show anything on the article page at all. It simply marks the topic as something related to Mormonism and therefore of interest to the editors working on LDS-related articles. Considering that one of the most prominent allegations against West Ridge is that it is a """"Mormon gulag"""" it most certainly appears likely that the LDS wikiproject might be interested in this page.

2601,"""My behavior, certainly as a newcomer to Wikipedia has never been destructive, nor am I a vandal. I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing """"edit warring"""" which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and """"revert warriors"""" who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the """"one-way"""" pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being """"disruptive"""" in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while """"revert warring"""" without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as """"proof"""" of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several """"reverts"""" on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to """"revert war"""" - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been """"revert warring"""" for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and """"reverters"""" who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the """"complaints"""" about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to """"use"""" him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

2619,"""

There are three things to point out about this discussion:
1. The """"material"""" concept of time. Time here is not intended as an abstract entity, a chronological coordinate, as we are used to.  A """"time"""" is the complex of all existing beings, things, circumstances and processes occurring in a particular historical instant. So it 's like an enormous set including everything existing or going on at that moment. If you consider the next instant, another enormous set is determined and that 's different form the previous one, as many things or situations have been changed. So we are included in the times because we are among the countless things and beings """"contained"""" in the flowing times.

2. Sorry Memoro, but I must notice that your feeling of a possible deponent behaviour of the verb """"muto"""" is baseless and factually incorrect.
Indeed, consulting several Latin grammars and dictionaries I found no trace, no hint of a use of """"muto"""" as a deponent or semi-deponent verb, at least in the classics. Simply, when a verb is provided with both forms, active and passive, it cannot be a deponent.
It is however true that """"mutare"""", as well as """"to change"""" in English, may have a transitive or intransitive meaning. When it is transitive there is someone who performs changing and someone who undergoes it; so we can use the active or passive form to determine who 's the agent. We can say  """"I change you"""" or """"I am changed by you"""", leaving no doubt on who 's the author and who the object of changing. In the second case (the passive one) it 's wholly evident that change is not due to my will.
With the intransitive meaning instead, the concept of voluntariness of change remains more shaded and vague. When I say: """"I change"""", I make quite clear that some changing is affecting myself, but nothing is said about whether this change is due to my will or to the events, circumstances or somebody else 's will. Thus, using the active form with intransitive meaning, we can leave an open door to both possibilities:  - a. I am changing because I actually want to, or - b. I am forced to change by circumstances or others.
Therefore, whoever was the author of this maxim, he had a simple way to let us think that we might be the artificers of our own change. He only had to write the verb in its active form: """"mutamus"""". A simple """"s"""" instead of an """"r"""". That wouldn 't even afffect the hexameter 's rhythm. But he (purposedly in my opinion) chose the passive form; so expressly underlining our """"passivity to the change"""".
Moreover, he used a special trick to give an even stronger emphasis to the passivity. Normally speaking in Latin, one would say """"et nos mutamur""""; but here we see """"nos et mutamur"""". Exchanging the pronoun with the conjunction is a rare expedient to emphasize the latter (in Latin language, everything that comes """"after"""" has higher importance in a sentence 's  context). This special exchange serves to point out that this """"nos et"""" is not a simple """"et nos""""; we should translate it as """"and we too""""; but other stronger translations could be: """"and we forcedly"""", """"and we ineluctably"""", """"and we a fortiori"""". 
All this drives me to the conclusion that the sentence 's author wanted to stress as much strongly as possible that we are """"passive"""" poor things in front of the general changing going on through the entire universe. So the true extensive meaning of the phrase is:
""""When everything existing in the universe is subject to change by circumstances and force majeure; how could we, poor little human things, pretend not being changed as well?""""
This way of reasoning comes quite natural if you """"think in Latin"""".

3. According to the ancient and medieval way of thinking, this sentence is nothing else than an Aristotelian categorical syllogism; i.e. the basic unit of logical reasoning.
Here we have:
- a major premise: """"Tempora mutantur""""
- a minor premise: """"in illis"""" saying that we humans are included in times 
- a conclusion: """"nos et mutamur"""".
That simply means we are forced to change because we are part of all things that are changed.
In mathematical logic and set theory, these relations concern set inclusion. So here are: 
a set H containing all humans; a set T containing all times (as defined above) and an even bigger set C containg all things, beings, situations, processes, and complexes af all them, that are subject to changing.
The minor premise states that H is included in T, the major premise says T is included in C and the conclusion is H is included in C.
In other words this is what 's usually defined as """"the transitive property of inclusion"""". Thus, a synthetic translation of our sentence in sheer mathematical terms is:   H ⊂ T, T ⊂ C   ⇒  H ⊂ C""",0

 discussions ongoing to establish conventions in some eastern civilizations

I observed that you have contributed to the discussion about article headings for Japanese monarchs and royals. It seems that these weeks, there are attempts to standardize such issues at several spots. One example is whether to standardize Thai royal persons. Of course, Thai and Japanese are totally different, for example regarding the need of disambiguation etc, and should probably be as separate as Eastern are in relation to european royalty naming. I think Japanese naming and Thai naming could end up to different conventions, and that is good if there are sufficient reasons for that.

 A great and grand success.... 

  Moment of Joy! What brought me to Wikipedia was the lack of information in the article of Meera. In mid-April 2012, after spending nearly 3 and a half months, I planned to add to those article which are seldom edited by others. Those included the Nawabs of Bengal & Murshidabad, articles related to it and soap opera articles. Soap operas are ongoing so I have to edit them daily but the article on the Nawabs is a piece of history...and I took up the work alone. Later, in May some editors helped me to fix typos and grammatical errors, but soon withdrew back their help. But, by God's grace I finished with the work today on 4 August 2012 and would love to share this success with you! My condition was same as the flying man in the pic, trying to catch a several things at the same time before it's too late. I don't know whether he succeeds or not, bu I did succeed! However, I still have to add some references and summarize the plots of soap opera articles in the soap opera articles. If you want, then you can help.

 Please don't imagine that I consider this a matter of great consequence or that I take any offense at your actions.

On another note, I think it is extremely poor form to delete any Talk page, even if the primary page is itself deleted  thus I say """"copy"""", and I think you are wise not to move the Talk to my user space. 

 I consider the RfC to be of exactly zero consequence. I took it seriously until Radiant flipped over the Etch-a-Sketch, shook, and started over. Now, it's simply become a joke, and I have Conan O'Brian for that if I want. But I appreciate your expression.

 If you want a real example of bottom-feeding, take a look at Netty's last edit to this Talk page.

 BP 

First of all, I understand that you have a stake in this article.  You've put a lot of time and effort into it and you don't want to see it deleted.  I had an article deleted once, and I understand the frustration that you feel.  

If you read what constitutes a notable organization in WP:N and WP:ORG, it doesn't really meet the criteria set forth.  Yes, you've provided some sources that mention the Bulldog Party, but they aren't really considered, Significant coverage which means, """"that sources address the subject directly in detail..."""".  Also, WP:ORG states """"Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found,"""" however, it does say that, """"The organization’s longevity, size of membership, or major achievements, or other factors specific to the organization may be considered.""""  The Bulldog Party may have been around in some form since the 1950s, though, so maybe that might help  if you can prove it. 

The possible longevity and the """"major achievements"""" and """"other factors specific to the organization"""" is where you stand the best chance of defining why it's notable, because of this statement in the article, """"The Bulldog Party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout Missouri, most notably the Bearcat Voice at Northwest Missouri State University and the Student Progressive Party at Lincoln University (Missouri).""""  However, this isn't sourced at all, and quite frankly, it's questionable whether the Bearcat Party article meet the notability criteria as well.

If I submitted this article to AFD, would it definitely get deleted?  Most definitely not.  There's a good chance that it would, but it's not a given.  However, no one could make the argument that it's good enough as it is and its notability shouldn't be questioned. 

Why has no one else brought this up before since you first created in March 2005?  Probably because it hasn't attracted a lot of attention and overall, it's well-written.  There aren't many other articles that link to it, so unless someone stumbles across it through those links, the only other way someone will find it is via Random Pages (unlikely with over 2 million other articles) or through Recent Changes (and since there have been barely over 50 edits in 3 years, that's not likely, either  especially if the edit wasn't vandalism).

Keep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping:
 I like it... or It's interesting....
 It took me a long time to write....
 This other student political party has an article....
 It looks good... or It doesn't do any harm...

I'm not going to submit this article to AFD, but you really need to work on getting it fixed (if possible), because it's likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that I did about it.   Good luck, and happy editing.    """,0

 Removing {{Fact}} Tags 

I have removed the {{fact}} tags from the first section of the article, as the use here seems to constitute a misunderstanding of what the {{fact}} tag is for. According to the Wikipedia citation guide: """"Not every statement in an article needs a citation, but if in doubt, provide one."""" The sentences in question are the sentences at the head of the article, which is the summary of the subject that the article is about. The source for the statements is the article itself, with the understanding that if a particular statement is questionable or contentious a citation will be given for it in the main body of the article. Admittedly, the sentences in the summary section are far from perfect, but it would be better to look at how the wording in them might be changed and improved rather than simply blindly demanding citations.""",0

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

No, you're confusing """"small probability of drift"""" with """"small drift"""".  They're not the same thing.

But when you're talking about random sampling, if there is any heterozygosity, then the probability of a change in allele frequency will never be absolutely zero.  But there are unlikely extremes allowed by any theory.  What we need to do is a better job of shading the issue.  It is absolutely true that genetic drift has traditionally been thought to be a non-issue in large populations, and that selection pressures tell the story over time.

2825,"M1 is East African (Abu Amero et al. 2007)==
Abu-Amero et al; 2007 licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
Eurasian and African mitochondrial DNA influences in the Saudi Arabian population

Macrohaplogroup M
Five of the eight M Saudi Arab lineages clustered into the M1 African haplogroup. Three of them had the 16359 transition that was diagnostic of the M1a East African cluster, and the remaining one belonged to the rare but widespread M1b1 cluster characterized in the HVSI region by 16185 transition and the 16190d deletion that had been identified in the northwest Africa, Jordan, and the Iberian Peninsula [27]. The other three M sequences belonged to Indian clades. One had the basic motif (16126, 16223) of the M3 haplogroup [28]. A second had the 15928 and 16304 transitions that defined haplogroup M25 [29], although this sequence [see Additional file 1] did not match any of the definite or putative M25 sequences found in India [29-31] or Pakistan [26].   

M1 originated in Africa (Semino)
The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens
Conversely, all non-M mtDNAs of non-African origin analysed so far carry 10873T. These data indicate that the **transition 10400 C>T, which defines haplogroup M**, arose on an African background characterized by the ancestral state 10873C, which is also present in four primate (common and pygmy chimps, gorilla and orangutan) mtDNA sequences.

 Cultural depictions of George Byron, 6th Baron Byron 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.

As I wrote:
When this arbcom started at 21 January 2010, we were at 52,000 unreferenced BLPs, today we are at 45,000. That is 7,000 articles we as a community have referenced in 17 days, and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:
User_talk:The-Pope#Your_idea_at_Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment.2FBiographies_of_living_people 
As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible. As an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past 4 years, and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles, this is a wonderful comprimise, with so much potential, I would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal.

Now here's some PHILOSOPHY (it seems there's no alternative User:Quiddity but to shout it:
   """"The history of philosophy is punctuated
   by revolts against the practices of previous
   philosophers and by attempts to transform 
   philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
   which universally recognized decision-
   procedures are available for testing phil-
   osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
   Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
   tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
   osophical Investigations, one finds the same
   disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
   quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
   The proposed remedy for this situation 
   typically consists in adopting a new 
   method: for example, the method of  “clear
   and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
   Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
   Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
   stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
   ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
   due attention to logical form, and the later
   Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-
   lessness of these theses by diagnosing the 
   causes of their having being propounded.  
   In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo-
   lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl-
   edge, and to propose as the proper mean-
   ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment 
   of some finite task by applying a certain set
   of mythological directions.

 Civility and stuff 

Regarding my last WP:FOOTY input, i have already replied you there. Here, i'll only add, other than a second apology to you, WP, WP:FOOTY and (some of) those concerned with some of the contents of my input: i can cope with being called """"stupid"""" (what's intelligence anyway), but VILE? Please think about what you wrote as well my friend.

Attentively -   
The events of the last week have been very disturbing and I was offended by what you said, so I can only imagine how someone who lost a loved one would've reacted to your comment. As I said before, think about what you write before you click that save button. Comparing a cheating footballer to a mass murder is wrong. talk 

I'll try to """"defend"""" myself once again, as i feel i did not manage it the last time around: i only chose that comparison to illustrate the level of vandalism occurring in the footballer's page (i did not compare anyone, i merely """"reasoned"""" - or did not! - if this occurs in a mere footballer page, what can be done with a real scumbag like that mass murderer and the ones like him), i only chose a very unfortunate example to guide me by. I guess you are very upset at me, and there's nothing i can say at this moment to """"turn back the tide"""", so i'll just be quiet for now...

No friends in real life, still have time to make enemies in the virtual world, even though i intend just the opposite -   
You don't have to apologise to me, I'm not going to hold it against you. It was an off the cuff remark and we all make them. If you look at the editing history of Sam Deering you will see an expansion I made after answering a request to do so.

I understand Eliot Freidson to be an excellent source, and she is cited by Larson as well (e.g. see page 7 & 8 for a direct quotations for her 1977 essay Health and the Division of Labour):
""""..ideal type constructions do not tell us what a profession is, only what it intends to be...my intention is to show how the occupations we call professions organized themselves to attain market power.""""
I think we can still use Larson, because her book provides more than sufficient coverage to extend the defintion to include these points. So if we extend the defintion further using the content of pages x and xi of her book , we get:
""""A profession is an in a service oriented occupation that is centered on a body of knowledge, techniques or skills that have been mastered through training, whose members form a community who share a relatively permanent affiliation through professional associations, professional schools, and a self-administered code of ethics. The specific attributes of an ideal type profession may vary, but the characteristics that make it a distinctive from other occupation are the privalege of autonomy derived from self-regulation and the prestige of having special competence.""""
Of course we cannot cover all the bases in the lead paragraph - this is simply the starting point, and these characteristics will be expanded upon subsequently. The choice of wording for this summary of Larson is my own, but this can be changed if it defective in any way. Perhaps we could split the definition between Larson and Freidson or even throw Perks into the mix. Again, I am open to suggestions on this defintion can be improved upon.

According to Simon Schama's book The Power of Art, Guernica was painted in response to an article that Picaso saw in an French newspaper. The first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell. He had agreed to do 'a politically minded painting' for a 1937 Paris Fair, but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in Geurnica unfolded. It was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work.

 

""""Quite possibly apocryphal""""
I cut this from the article.

A story, quite possibly apocryphal, circulates about Guernica. During World War II, a German officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time, in the presence of Picasso.  In a wondering tone he asks Picasso """"Did you do this?"""" and Picasso replies: """"No, you did.""""

If it is """"quite possibly apocryphal"""" and we have no attribution or citation, it does not belong in the article.   | Talk 02:33, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Except that this is extremely widely believed and noted.  I recall hearing the equivalent when I was at the Prado. -  02:40, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told. (& was Guernica ever in the Prado? In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   | Talk 07:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -  13:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:
Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, """"Did you do that?,"""" Picasso coldly had replied, """"No, you did."""" 
Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)
 We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   | Talk 16:05, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)
 Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  · Talk 16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

I reverted this from Category:Paintings containing nudity to Category:Paintings. Clearly, the fact that one naked female human breast is visible in the painting is a very minor fact about the painting; no one by a very weird obsessive would look for it there.

I can certainly handle that ) I was thinking of your """"stress"""" talk/post from a while back, I also pretty much quit editing after some highly fatiguing moments last year (in which I eventually prevailed through arbitration); on pages where you'd never have expected arguments! I am bilingual and binational in Canada, which makes my cultural sensitivities and awareness a little over the top. Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most).

Reply to Mr. Burdak
I am glad to see you have at least referenced that quote now - it was not at all clear before where it came from. As it does not agree with standard translations of that passage, one wonders about the unusual wording - so reminiscent of the odd """"quote"""" you made from the Mahabharata the other day. 

But, more importantly, what about the completely false """"reference"""" to """"The History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. II""""? Why have you (again) not replied to my pointing out of this apparent dishonesty? This is only the most recent in a very long list of false """"quotes"""" and """"references"""" you have made and I have exposed on these pages - as you well know. Now, I am willing to accept that maybe one or two false quotes could be the result of honest mistakes or sloppy research - but when the process is repeated over and over and over again one begins to suspect that the author is doing it deliberately and intends to deceive readers. So, quite naturally, I and others have come to mistrust any quotes you may give - especially to sources that are difficult to check. I am sorry - but you have brought this situation upon yourself.

Historically, testicle cuffs may have been used by the slave traders of Western Africa, as a means to subdue newly-captured males.

The testicle cuffs extended between the legs, and each man was connected to the next by a rope between their genitals.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",0

3060,"Conferences are a problem I've been meaning to work on. There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here. 
The main thing I think we want to avoid is writing articles on individual conferences in a series. This would amount to our being a nonselective index or bibliography. '''''' ( talk )",0

Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a """"reprimand"""" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one.

Your make a good point.  Let me first address it from the perspective of Marshall Hodgson.

Civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term, often narrowly defined by language.  This obviously has its limits.  On the other hand, the more broadly you define a civilization, the more subgroupings it must include.  Eventually, we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand.  And ultimately, civilizations, like religions, are self-defined.

Hodgson considers the lands of Islam to constitute a world civilization.  He calls Islam a world civilization in the title of his book The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization.

For another perspective, I can turn to H. Patrick Glenn, in Legal Traditions of the World, speaking on tradition and identity.  Not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition, or civilization.

Glenn quotes Fernand Braudel, who speaks of an """"underlying structure"""" of civilization; """"those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change, or more probably disappearance, of the tradition itself.""""  Applying this criteria to Islamic civilization, one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of Islam.

To summarize: looking at the lands of Islam, with its concept of Umma, the shared traditions, the shared Arabic religious and often secular language, and indeed the shared religion of Islam, it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world Islamic civilization.

Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine.

To me, to call them """"battleships"""" is confusing - they were not the equal of the """"Bismarcks"""" nor even of the """"KG5s"""". They certainly had the capability to be upgraded to """"proper"""" battleships, it was a design feature and, I think, work did start on the Gneisenau. 

I accept that the German term """"Schlachtkreuzer"""" translates directly into """"battleship"""", so what? This is the English language Wiki and should convey meaning to English speakers. """"Battlecruisers"""" were at a disadvantage to """"battleships"""": see Hood and Scharnhorst - and to me, that's the point. Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it's a language issue. After all the Graf Spee, Scheer and Lutzow/ Deutschland have had differing descriptions in English (""""pocket battleship"""" or """"heavy cruiser"""") and German (""""panzerschiff"""").

I had thought that the accepted way forward was to explain the differing views, when appropriate.
